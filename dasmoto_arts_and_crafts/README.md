# Dasmoto arts and Crafts

This is my first attempt at structuring and styling a basic static website with HTML & CSS.

A detailed brief was provided on CodeCademy website. My task is to buil the website according to that brief shown below:

However I didn't like their design suggestion, so I attempted to improve it a little with slightly different layout of the elements and other improvements.

The project in its current state can be viewed at the following URL: <https://wglebster.github.io/dasmoto/dasmoto.html>
