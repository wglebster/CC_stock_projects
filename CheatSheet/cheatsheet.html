                    <h3>Position: Relative</h3>This value allows you to position an element <em>relative to its default <strong>position</strong> </em> on the web page. Relative offset needs to be specified by accompanying the position declaration with one
                    or more of the following offset properties that will move the element away from its default static position:
                    <ul>
                        <li>top - moves the element down from the top</li>
                        <li>bottom - moves the element up from the bottom</li>
                        <li>left - moves the element away from the left side (to the right)</li>
                        <li>right - moves the element away from the right side (to the left)</li>
                    </ul>
                    You can specify values in pixels, ems, or percentages, among others, to dial in exactly how far you need the element to move. It’s also important to note that offset properties will not work if the element’s position property is the default static.

                    <h3>Position: Absolute</h3>
                    Another way of modifying the position of an element is by setting its position to absolute. When an element's position is set to absolute, all other elements on the page will ignore the element and act like it is not present on the page. The element <em>will
                    be positioned relative to its closest positioned parent element</em>, while offset properties can be used to determine the final position from there.

                    by setting its position to fixed, and accompanying it with the offset properties top, bottom, left, and right.

                    <h3>Position: Sticky</h3>
                    The sticky value is another position value that keeps an element in the document flow as the user scrolls, but sticks to a specified position as the page is scrolled further. This is done by using the sticky value along with the offset properties. In
                    the example on the left, the .box-bottom <em>div</em> will remain in its relative position, and scroll as usual. When it reaches 240 pixels from the top, it will stick to that position until it reaches the bottom
                    of its parent container where it will “unstick” and rejoin the flow of the document.

                    <h3>Display: inline</h3>
                    <p>The default display for some elements, such as <em>em/strong</em> and <em>a</em>, is called inline. Inline elements have a box that wraps tightly around their content, only taking up the amount of space necessary to display their content
                        and not requiring a new line after each element. The height and width of these elements cannot be specified in the CSS document.</p>
                    <p>The CSS <em>display</em> property provides the ability to make any element an inline element. This includes elements that are not inline by default such as paragraphs, divs, and headings.</p>

                    <h3>Display: Block</h3>
                    <p>Some elements are not displayed in the same line as the content around them. These are called block-level elements. These elements fill the entire width of the page by default, but their width property can also be set. Unless otherwise
                        specified, they are the height necessary to accommodate their content.</p>

                    <h3>Display: Inline-Block</h3>
                    <p>The third value for the display property is inline-block. Inline-block display combines features of both inline and block elements. Inline-block elements can appear next to each other and we can specify their dimensions using the width
                        and height properties. Images are the best example of default inline-block elements.</p>

                    <h3>Media Queries</h3>
                    <p>CSS uses media queries to adapt a website’s content to different screen sizes. With media queries, CSS can detect the size of the current screen and apply different CSS styles depending on the width of the screen.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <code>@media</code> — This keyword begins a media query rule and instructs the CSS compiler on how to parse the rest of the rule.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>only screen</code> — Indicates what types of devices should use this rule. In early attempts to target different devices, CSS incorporated different media types (screen, print, handheld). The rationale was that by knowing the media type, the proper CSS rules could be applied. However, “handheld” and “screen” devices began to occupy a much wider range of sizes and having only one CSS rule per media device was not sufficient. screen is the media type always used for displaying content, no matter the type of device. The only keyword is added to indicate that this rule only applies to one media type (screen).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>and (max-width : 480px)</code> — This part of the rule is called a media feature, and instructs the CSS compiler to apply the CSS styles to devices with a width of 480 pixels or smaller. Media features are the conditions that must be met in order to render the CSS within a media query.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            CSS rules are nested inside of the media query’s curly braces. The rules will be applied when the media query is met. In the example above, the text in the body element is set to a font-size of 12px when the user’s screen is less than 480px.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>And Operator</h3>
                            <p>The and operator can be used to require multiple media features. Therefore, we can use the and operator to require both a max-width of 480px and to have a min-resolution of 300dpi.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Comma Separated List</h3>
                            <p>If only one of multiple media features in a media query must be met, media features can be separated in a comma separated list.

                            For example, if we needed to apply a style when only one of the below is true:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The screen is more than 480 pixels wide</li>
                                <li>The screen is in landscape mode</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                    <h3>Breakpoints</h3>
                    <p>The points at which media queries are set are called breakpoints. Breakpoints are the screen sizes at which your web page does not appear properly. 
                    Rather than set breakpoints based on specific devices, the best practice is to resize your browser to view where the website naturally breaks based on its content. The dimensions at which the layout breaks or looks odd become your media query breakpoints. Within those breakpoints, we can adjust the CSS to make the page resize and reorganize.

                <p>Any element can be a flex container. Child elements of flex containers. For an element to become a flex container, its <code>display</code> property must be set to <code>flex</code>.
                <br>
                A div with the declaration <code>display: flex;</code> will remain block level — no other elements will appear on the same line as it.
                However, it will change the behavior of its child elements. Child elements will not begin on new lines.

                <p>If we didn’t want div elements to be block-level elements, we would use <code>display: inline</code>. Flexbox, however, provides the <code>inline-flex</code> value for the display property, which allows us to create flex containers that are also inline elements. When we change the value of the display property to inline-flex, the divs will display inline with each other if the page is wide enough.
                the size of the flex container is set. Currently, the size of the parent container will override the size of its child elements. If the parent element is too small, the flex items will shrink to accommodate the parent container’s size.

                <p>We can specify how flex items spread out from left to right, along the main axis. We will learn more about axes in a later exercise.
                To position the items from left to right, we use a property called   <code>justify-content</code>.
                Five commonly used values for the justify-content properties:
                <ul>
                    <li>flex-start - all items will be positioned in order, starting from the left of the parent container, with no extra space between or before them.
                    </li>
                    <li>flex-end — all items will be positioned in order, with the last item starting on the right side of the parent container, with no extra space between or after them.
                    </li>
                    <li>center — all items will be positioned in order, in the center of the parent container with no extra space before, between, or after them.
                    </li>
                    <li>space-around — items will be positioned with equal space before and after each item, resulting in double the space between elements.
                    </li>
                    <li>space-between — items will be positioned with equal space between them, but no extra space before the first or after the last elements.
                    </li>
                </ul>
