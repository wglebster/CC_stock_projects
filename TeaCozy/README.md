# TeaCozy

This standard CodeCademy project involved styling a web page using ***flexbox***. 

I also encountered a bug which took me while to fix. 
Initially I had a blank space between the header bottom border and the image below it. However upon investigation, the solution turned out to be quite simple. I added vertical-align: bottom in the header element CSS.
