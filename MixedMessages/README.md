# MixedMessages

This is my first coding project completed fully off the CodeCademy platform.

## Project brief

Build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. Youâ€™re welcome to take the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. Take what you know of JavaScript syntax so far to build the program and customize it to your liking.

## Purpose

To practice working with JavaScript, setup GitHub repository, use command line (bash).

### Language(s) used

JavaScript

### Possible improvements

Allow user input in the console.

#### Disclaimer

I musunderstood the assignment brief. Instead of outputting a jumbled up message consisting of at least 3 pieces of data, I am outputting actual (sometimes funny) jokes or motivational quotes depending on specified parameter.

##### Acknowledgement

The jokes were forked from:
